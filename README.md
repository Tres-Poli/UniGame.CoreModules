# Getting Started

## How to Install

Add to your project manifiest by path [%UnityProject%]/Packages/manifiest.json new Scope:

```json
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "UniGame",
      "url": "http://packages.unigame.pro:4873/",
      "scopes": [
        "com.unigame",
        "com.littlebigfun",
        "com.alelievr"
      ]
    },
    
    "__comment":"another scoped registers",
    
  ],
}

```

Now install via Package Manager

    {
      "name": "package.openupm.com",
      "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
      "scopes": [
        "com.coffee",
        "com.coffee.ui-particle",
        "com.coffee.ui-effect",
        "com.littlebigfun.addressable-importer",
        "com.yasirkula",
        "com.yasirkula.assetusagedetector",

      ]
    },
 
```

# Modules

## LifeTime


Main idea comes from JetBrains LifeTime pattern.

- https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/sdk/Platform/Lifetime.html

Any shared resource/service MUST have single owner.  main rule for fluent resources managment: One resource - One owner
That rule make make all resource management pretty straightforward and allow to construct hierarchical dependencies.

### Base API

```cs

    public interface ILifeTime
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// cleanup action, call when life time terminated
        /// </summary>
        ILifeTime AddCleanUpAction(Action cleanAction);

        /// <summary>
        /// add child disposable object
        /// </summary>
        ILifeTime AddDispose(IDisposable item);

        /// <summary>
        /// save object from GC
        /// </summary>
        ILifeTime AddRef(object o);

        /// <summary>
        /// is lifetime terminated
        /// </summary>
        bool IsTerminated { get; }
    }
    
```

#### LifeTime Creation

you can't create instance of LifeTime class directly, but there is easy way to achieve it

```cs

  LifeTimeDefinition lifeTime = new LifeTimeDefinition();

```

```cs

  LifeTime lifeTime = LifeTime.Create();

```

every instance of LifeTime has unique runtime Id.

you must always share only interface **"LifeTime"** where it needed for resources management and never allow direct access to LifeTime instance. That's guarantee that only owner can Terminate your resources
